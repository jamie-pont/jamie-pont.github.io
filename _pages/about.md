I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate working at the <a href="https://www.kent.ac.uk/">University of Kent</a>. My PhD, titled <q cite="https://kar.kent.ac.uk/100606/1/133pont2023phdfinal.pdf">Identifying Ransomware Through Statistical and Behavioural Analysis</q>, focused on the early detection and mitigation of ransomware attacks. The fight against malware, and ransomware in particular, is highly inter-disciplinary by nature, and as such I have worked with teams of psychologists, economists and criminologists, and contributed to the <a href="https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=EP%2FP011772%2F1">EMPHASIS Project</a>. During this time, I also worked on Random Number Generator (RNG) analysis, and have since worked on various research projects covering Quantum Computing to Network Security.

My current research focuses on the evaluation of trust in dynamic and large-scale network environments, making use of subjective logic in order to reason about trust in the presence of uncertainty.

I am always open to discussing research ideas and opportunities for collaboration, so please <a href="mailto:J.Pont@kent.ac.uk>">contact me</a> if you would like to work with me.
